# Cplusplus-Program

# Sumarize the project and what problem it solved.
I created a program that displays a 12 and 24 hour clock. It allows the user to set the time and display the time. This is helpful to add to a website for a company that is not for sure what time standard would be required. 

# What did I do particularly well.
I did well in the fact that I used functions to minimize the code in the main function. This helps brake the code apart and make it easier to imploment new code into the project. I also did good on what was needed for this project.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on.
I could enhance the main funtion by getting rid of the system clear. This would help the code run a little faster. I also believe that there are steps to make it more secure but I am not aware of these ways yet.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network
I first found making seperate functions challenging. This was because I was not to comfortable with them, but now with more practice I feel better about them. I overcame it by more practice. I used the homework to help me out with this process.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work.
It is important to use funtions and classes for c++ and this will transfer to other projects and work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
I made the code maintaninable by braking it up into pieces, classes, and funtions. I made it easy to read by commenting parts of the code, and making variables have a purpose.
